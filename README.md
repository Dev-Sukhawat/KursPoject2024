## 🧠 Why This Project
### 📖 Project Description: Interactive and Responsive Website

Course Module: JavaScript and HTML & CSS

Purpose:
The goal of this project is for students to apply and integrate their knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by creating a dynamic, interactive, and responsive website. The project aims to develop the ability to create user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible web experiences that function seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
#### 🧱 Design and Development
* Create a multi-page website with a consistent and professional design.
* Use semantic HTML5 to structure the content effectively.
* Implement CSS3 for advanced styling, including animations and transitions.
* Use JavaScript to add interactivity, such as dynamic menus, image galleries, or form validation.

#### 📱 Responsiveness
* Apply modern CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.
* Use media queries to adapt the design for various devices and screen sizes.
* Ensure that all content and functions are accessible and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile.

#### 🧭 User Experience
* Design an intuitive navigation structure that is easy to understand and use.
* Optimize performance by minimizing code and optimizing images.
* Follow accessibility and usability standards (such as WCAG).

### 🧩 Project Requirements

Structure and Content
* At least three interconnected web pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
* Use external CSS and JavaScript files for better organization and maintainability.

Interactivity
* Implement at least two interactive JavaScript features (e.g., image sliders, dropdown menus, or interactive maps).
* Use event listeners and DOM manipulation to improve the user experience.

Responsive Design
* The layout must adapt smoothly to various screen sizes without losing functionality or visual appeal.
* Test the website on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

Code Quality

* Keep code well-structured, indented, and compliant with coding standards.
* Comment the code where necessary to explain logic and functions.
* Use descriptive names for classes, IDs, and variables..

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Add gallery search & filter by category or year.
* Improve responsiveness for mobile/touch screens.
* Implement light/dark mode toggle.
* Add smooth animations & transitions.
* Expand with API-based sci-fi media data.
